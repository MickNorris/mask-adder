# Mask Adder

This program attempts to use the python [face-recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) library to detect facial landmarks (eyes, mouth, nose, etc) and add a mask over the mouth and nose.

## Why?
My overall goal is to make this into a twitter bot so people can mention the bot, and the bot will reply with their profile picture with a mask over their face

## TODO (in no particular order):
 - Handle multiple faces
 - Handle mask rotation better
 - Use a better mask photo
